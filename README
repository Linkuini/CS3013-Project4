This project handles the creation of and usage of a virtual memory system including a RAM, SSD, and HD using arrays and delays.
The folder RandomEviction implements a page eviction algorithm which randomly selects a page from the necessary array and
evicts it. The folder HistoryEviction implements a LRU page eviction algorithm. 

Our programs do not support multithreading and have not implemented mutual exclusion.

To run compile either of these programs, enter the given folder and enter "make". Then, to compile enter "./VirtualMemory <NUMBER>" where NUMBER
is an integer from 0 to 5, and determines which function to run in the main function. If a number is not specified, or is specified to be a number
outside of this range, the program will run our default test. The functions related to their numbers are shown below:

0 - mainTest() - default testing function, used for debugging during development
1 - memoryMaxer() - function given in the project description. This program fills the memory, changes their values, and then frees the memory
2 - memoryOverload() - attempts to allocate more memory which is allowed
3 - tryLock() - attempts to add or evict pages from a memory which is completely locked
4 - accessNothing - attempts to call accessIntPtr without allocating memory previously
5 - accessTwice() - attempts to access and change the memory in two different loops
